Tennis Scoreboard
============

## Introduction

This is a simple tennis scoreboard project that I created as part of my learning journey in web development. The project is built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap framework. It allows users to track and update scores, games, and sets for a tennis match by clicking buttons on the scoreboard interface.

As a learning developer, this project provided me with an opportunity to practice my HTML, CSS, and JavaScript skills

## Features

- Track and update the score for each point won by either player.
- Increment the game score and automatically update the set score accordingly.
- Easily reset the scores to start a new game or match.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/tennis-scoreboard.git`
2. Open the `index.html` file in your preferred web browser.
3. Start tracking the tennis scores by clicking on the buttons provided.
4. Use the reset button to begin a new game or match.


## Future Improvements

As a learning developer, I understand that there is always room for improvement. Here are some ideas for future enhancements:

- Adding support for tiebreakers 
- Creating a timer/stopwatch for match duration.
- Improving responsive design for all viewports.
